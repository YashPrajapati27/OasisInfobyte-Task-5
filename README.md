## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to forecast sales prices using a Linear Regression model. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to achieve precise and reliable predictions that can inform business decisions.

## Project Workflow
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preparation
We meticulously gathered a comprehensive dataset containing relevant sales-related features. Employing Pandas and NumPy, we cleaned the data, handled missing values, and engineered features to ensure its readiness for modeling.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn, we embarked on an exploratory journey, visualizing relationships between variables and uncovering insights that informed our feature selection and model building process.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development
Using Scikit-learn, we constructed a Linear Regression model and trained it on our prepared dataset. We fine-tuned model parameters and evaluated performance to ensure optimal predictive capabilities.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
Through rigorous testing and validation, we assessed the model's accuracy and robustness. Utilizing visualization techniques, we scrutinized performance metrics, gaining valuable insights into model performance and areas for improvement.
